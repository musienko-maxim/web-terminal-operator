== Installation

The Web Terminal can be installed via OperatorHub on Openshift Clusters. To install, press the **Install** button, choose the upgrade strategy, and wait for the **Installed** Operator status.

When the operator is installed, and you refresh your page, you will see a terminal button appear on the top right of the console.
