== Introduction

The Web Terminal Operator allows you to start a terminal inside of your browser with common CLI tools for interacting with the cluster.

**Note:** The OpenShift console integration that allows easily creating web terminal instances
and logging in automatically is available in OpenShift 4.5.3 and higher. In previous versions of
OpenShift, the operator can be installed but web terminals will have to be created and accessed
manually.
